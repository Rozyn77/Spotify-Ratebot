# Discord Music Rating Bot

This Discord bot automates and manages a song rating game. Instead of relying on external APIs, it cleverly monitors user activity on Discord to automatically detect the currently playing Spotify track, then allows other players to rate it using emojis.

# **‚ö†This bot is currently only available in Polish and contains potential visual glitches/delays.‚ö†**

### Key Features

* **Automated Song Detection:** The bot identifies and displays song details (title, artist, album art) from an active user's Spotify status.
* **Emoji-Based Rating System:** Participants can rate songs on a scale from 0Ô∏è‚É£ to üîü using emoji reactions.
* **Scorekeeping & Leaderboard:** The bot calculates average ratings for each song and compiles a final leaderboard for all participants, as well as a list of the highest-rated songs.
* **Spam Prevention:** The bot includes a system to prevent rating spam, with a mechanism to disqualify repeat offenders.
* **Game Flow Automation:** It manages the entire game process, from player registration and song submission to the final score tally.
* **The currently playing song link** The embed message contains a clickable title directly to the song on Spotify.
* **‚ö†This bot does NOT support playing the songs itself!‚ö†** To properly play the game you need to use Spotify's synchronised listening jam or other methods like manualy playing it (it's best for all players to listen to the same audio in sync)
